{"name":"Mastering PhoneGap Mobile Application Development","tagline":"Code bundle for Mastering PhoneGap Mobile Application Development","body":"# Mastering PhoneGap Code Bundle\r\n\r\nThis repository stores the code for the book entitled Mastering PhoneGap Mobile Application Development published by\r\nPackt Publishing. You can purchase the book at\r\n[Packt's Site](http://www.packtpub.com/mastering_phonegap-mobile-application-development-hotshot/book). If you obtained\r\nthe code package from Packt, you may wish to download the package from GitHub in order to receive the most recent changes.\r\nThe package is available at <https://github.com/kerrishotts/Mastering-PhoneGap-Code-Package>\r\n\r\n> **NOTE:** This book is under active development. As such, the contents of this repository are not yet finalized.\r\n\r\nThe code herein is not a complete Cordova project. The build artifacts (namely the `platforms`, `plugins`, etc., directories)\r\nare ignored. Only the `src` directory,`config.xml`, and assets for each project are provided. In order to execute any of these\r\nprojects, you'll need to create a new Cordova project and copy the relevant files from this repository into your project.\r\n\r\n> You should also check out [notes.md](./notes.md) within this repository -- there are important issues and discussions of\r\nwhich you should be aware.\r\n\r\n# Table of Contents\r\n\r\n* [Chapter/Project Lookup](#chapterproject-lookup)\r\n* [Application Demos](#application-demos)\r\n* [Useful Directories](#useful-directories)\r\n* [Useful Scripts](#useful-scripts)\r\n* [Using PhoneGap Build](#using-phonegap-build)\r\n* [Additional Project Information](#additional-project-information)\r\n* [License](#license)\r\n\r\n## [Chapter/Project Lookup](id:chapterproject-lookup)\r\n\r\n|    Chapter | Title                              | Project             | App.io Demo\r\n|-----------:|:---------------------------------- |:--------------------|:------------\r\n|          1 | Task Automation                    | [LogologyV1](#v1)   | N/A\r\n|          2 | Modules                            | [LogologyV2](#v2)   | N/A\r\n|          3 | Sassy CSS                          | [LogologyV3](#v3)   | N/A\r\n|          4 | More Responsive Design             | [LogologyV4](#v4)   | N/A\r\n|          5 | Accessibility                      | [LogologyV5](#v5)   | N/A\r\n|          6 | IndexedDB                          | [LogologyV6](#v6)   | N/A\r\n|          7 | SQLite                             | [LogologyV7](#v7)   | N/A\r\n|          8 | File Transfer                      | [LogologyV8](#v8)   | N/A\r\n|          9 | In-App Purchases                   | [LogologyV9](#v9)   | N/A\r\n|         10 | Developing Custom Plugins          | [LogologyV10](#v10) | N/A\r\n|         11 | Graphical Assets                   | [LogologyV11](#v11) | N/A\r\n|         12 | Deployment                         | [LogologyV12](#v12) | [Demo](https://app.io/kAxEF4) (offsite)\r\n\r\n## [Application Demos](id:application-demos)\r\n\r\nI've taken the time to upload the final versions of Logology to [App.io](http://www.app.io).\r\n**Note:** It is not possible to simulate all aspects of each app; pay attention to what features are not available.\r\n\r\n* [Logology V12](https://app.io/kAxEF4) (offsite)\r\n  * The simulator does not provide for in-app purchases or accessibility settings.\r\n\r\n## [Useful Directories](id:useful-directories)\r\n\r\nOther than the actual code for each project, the following directories may be of interest to you:\r\n\r\n* `/design`\r\n  * Contains icons and splash screen for each project. Also contains design documents for each project in PDF and\r\n    OmniGraffle format.\r\n* `/template`\r\n  * Contains the template we used to create each project (`cordova create ... --copy-from ./template`).\r\n* `/framework`\r\n  * Contains the version of the YASMF-Next framework that was used to build the projects. You are welcome to update the\r\n    framework version at any time, but it is always possible that new framework versions might break the apps.\r\n\r\n## [Useful Scripts](id:useful-scripts)\r\n\r\nContained within the top level of this project are several useful scripts. **NOTE:** Your use of these scripts is at\r\nyour own risk. Neither the author of the book and code nor Packt Publishing can be held liable for the use, abuse,\r\nor misuse of these scripts.\r\n\r\n## [Using PhoneGap Build](id:using-phonegap-build)\r\n\r\nThe projects as delivered are *Cordova* projects. In order to utilize them with PhoneGap build, you will need to follow these steps:\r\n\r\n* Copy `config.xml` from the application root to the `www` directory.\r\n* Add the required plugins to `config.xml`, using the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<gap:plugin name=\"reverse.domain.id\"/>\r\n```\r\n* If you want to add the icon and splash screen assets to the project, you'll need to copy the appropriate icons from the `design` directory into the project's `www` directory, and then update `config.xml` using [these directions](http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/configuring_icons_and_splash.md.html#Icons%20and%20Splash%20Screens).\r\n* Upload the project to PhoneGap Build by using `phonegap remote build android` (or `ios`).\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Additional Project Information](id:additional-project-information)\r\n\r\n### [Logology V1](id:v1)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V2](id:v2)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V3](id:v3)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V4](id:v4)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V5](id:v5)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V6](id:v6)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V7](id:v7)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V8](id:v8)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V9](id:v9)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V10](id:v10)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V11](id:v11)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Logology V12](id:v12)\r\n\r\n#### Plugins Required\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n## [License](id:license)\r\n\r\nThe code herein is licensed under the MIT license.
