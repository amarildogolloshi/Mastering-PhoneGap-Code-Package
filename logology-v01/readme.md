# Logology v1.0.0

This is the first project for the book, and we're focusing on the build system for the first three versions. As such, the code for
the project is correspondingly simple. The main code is in the Gulp configuration file.

> NOTE: There are two Gulp configurations. In the book it is easier to compress everything into a single file, but that's not ideal
> in the longterm. As such, we've split out the Gulp configuration into a modularized piece under `gulp/`. If you want to see the
> configuration in a single file, see `gulpfile.all.in.one.js`.
